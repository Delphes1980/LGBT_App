LGBTQ Application

From the beginning of the humanity, LGBT people always existed. With the humanity evolution, appears new labels: gay, lesbian, trans, asexual, non-binary..
This application has the goal to help people who interrogate themselves about their sexuality or gender identity, or people who just wants to learn more about all of these new labels in order to become allies of LGBTQ communities. 
This application will describe the history of LGBTQ community, the people that contributed to the evolution of mindset, and all the different labels that we speak about nowaday with their definitions.

Why the project is useful?
Because a lot of people interrogated themselves about their sexual orientation or gender identity without putting a name on it. Even if labelization is not important, for some people, it is important to belong to a community of people who are like them.
It's also useful for their families to understand who they are and how to help them be themselves and become a better allies.

Architecture of the project:

First, the history of LGBTQ community, with differents principal events that mark the community with illustrations (photos, videos, articles, interviews..).
Then the different definitions of the different labels with a description, their flag (if there's one), their history with illustrations too.
And the different kinds of terms using in LGBTQ community such as coming in, coming out, pride, marriage and parentality.
